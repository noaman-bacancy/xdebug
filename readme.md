1. Update your IP address in the `xdebug.ini` file.
2. Build the Docker containers using `docker-compose build`.
3. Start the Docker containers in detached mode using `docker-compose up -d`.
4. Configure PhpStorm to work with your Dockerized PHP environment.

Make sure to follow these steps carefully:

1. **Update IP Address in xdebug.ini:**
   Edit the `xdebug.ini` file and replace the placeholder IP address with your actual IP address.

2. **Build Docker Containers:**
   Execute `docker-compose build` in terminal to build the Docker containers defined in your `docker-compose.yml` file.

3. **Start Docker Containers:**
   Run `docker-compose up -d` in your terminal to start the Docker containers in detached mode.

4. **Configure PhpStorm:**
   - Open PhpStorm.
   - Navigate to "Settings" or "Preferences" depending on your operating system.
   - In the Settings/Preferences dialog, go to "Languages & Frameworks" > "PHP" > "Servers".
   - Click the "+" icon to add a new server.
   - Enter a name for your server.
   - Set the host to your Docker container's IP address.
   - Optionally, set a port (usually 80 for HTTP).
   - Check the "Use path mappings" option and map your project directory on your local machine to the appropriate directory within the Docker container.
   - Save the configuration.

Now, you should be able to set breakpoints and debug your PHP code using PhpStorm with your Dockerized environment.
